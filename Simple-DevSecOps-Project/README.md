- We will install our Jenkins CI/CD tool on an Ubuntu 22.04 server.
- We will perform the Docker installation.
- We will run our SonarQube application as a container on the Jenkins server.
- We will download the application developed by the Development team from the Git repository into our Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
- Using Jenkins, we will send our code to SonarQube for analysis.
- After the analysis, we will convert our code into an image using the “Dockerfile,” and then run the Docker image on our host to publish the application.

  # Final Output
  As the result of the workflow, we will display a web page similar to the one shown below.
